Low-level Project

This project, built in GODOT, contains a number of experiments with shaders. The first is a simple 2D shader, 
which largely followed Professor Harris' "Shaders in Godot" tutorial to develop a simple pixel flame effect. 
The second is a 3D spatial water shader built following the Godot 3D shader tutorials. The third is another
3D spatial shader built through experimentation after using the previous tutorial. All of these shaders can be
viewed by opening the godot project and viewing the included scenes.
